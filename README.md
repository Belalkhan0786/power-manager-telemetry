3.	Features Offered
CPU Power Management: Modern CPUs use various techniques to manage and optimise the power consumption and thermal management. These techniques help balance performance and power efficiency of the system.

Telemetry: Telemetry refers to the automated collection and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible points to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis. If we consider the CPU power management, telemetry data includes the parameters such as 
•	Power consumption
•	Temperature
•	Voltage
•	Frequency
•	CPU utilization 
•	NIC

Real-Time Data Collection
•	Continuous Monitoring: Collect real-time data on CPU power consumption, temperature, voltage, and frequency.

Relevance: Efficient power management is crucial in today's computing environments to reduce energy costs, extend battery life in portable devices, and minimize thermal output. Power manager telemetry provides valuable insights into how power is used and where optimizations can be made.

4.	System Architecture
Hardware Components:
•	CPU: The central processing unit whose power telemetry is being monitored.

•	Sensors: Integrated or external sensors that measure power consumption, temperature, and other relevant parameters.


Software Components:
•	Telemetry Agent:  A software agent running on the system that collects telemetry data from the CPU and sensors.
•	Data Storage:  A database or other storage system where telemetry data is logged.
•	Analysis Tools:  Software tools used to analyze the collected data, such as statistical analysis software or machine learning algorithms.

5.	Process Flow

•	Data Collection: The telemetry agent collects data from the CPU and    sensors.
